    <h1>Life on the bus and how we got here</h1>
   
    <p>
Dear World 🌎 ,

(if reading out loud, please clear one's throat and continue in an English accent. 🤓)

<br>
<br>

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate the rhythms of our daily lives, I wanted to share with you a thought-provoking journey we often overlook – "Life on the Bus." dun dun duuuuuu,

In the rhythmic hum of the bus engine,(rhythmic?😒) our path through life unfolds. Each stop, a chapter; each passenger, a story. Together, let's go on a journey and trace the paths that brought us to this moment.
<br>
<br>

It all started in the spring of 2022 when one family of 10 decided to sell their house and convert a bus. It was the second bus conversion they had done, so they had a small idea of what to do. 2 months later they had already sold their house 🏠 and bought a 45-foot bus. 

As they converted it they stayed in the first bus conversation they had done, a shuttle bus. They worked all summer trying to finish before the cold weather, but alas they could not. Nevertheless, they left their hometown right before Christmas (although they didn't have water or a toilet 😦) That was over a year ago and they have all those things now, plus a washer and dryer. 
<br>
<br>
I'm excited to delve into the intricacies of our collective voyage and discover the tales the road ahead holds. Join me in exploring the beauty and connections found in the simple yet profound experience of life on the bus.
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to sharing this journey with you.
<br>
<br>
Warm regards,
<br>
<br>
Labadubada

 <h3>Why Labadubada Matters</h3>      
  <p>Dear World 🌎

I wanted to take a moment to share why Labadubada, (the blog you were currently in) matters.
<br>
<br>
That's the thing it doesn't (at least to you) but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a purpose. I believe Labadubada's purpose is to bring entertainment and a new meaning to the phrase "life on the road".
<br>
<br>
I aim to give a different perspective on living in a camper than what would usually be given. Oh wait I don't live in a camper—what a waste of time! 😤 as you know I live in a bus, but not the one to go around in (unless you're a professional basketball player). Me and my family live in a 45-foot MCI bus. And then blah blah blah with all the technical stuff. 😑 got to go so...
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time, and I hope Labadubada brings as much joy and inspiration as it has to me.
<br>
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
<br>
Labadubada
